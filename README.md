## ‚ú® What the App Does
### Core Gameplay
* Full **Blackjack** rules: hit, stand, double, split (1 √ó per round), dealer stands on 17.
* **Automatic shoe shuffle** every round.
* **Split hands UI** with live highlight: the active hand is bright; the waiting hand is dimmed.
* **Auto-Play mode** ‚Äî an optional basic-strategy bot that plays perfect Blackjack hands autonomously.

### Visuals & UX
* Table-background image and card sprites (standard 52-card deck).
* Overlapping/rotated card stacks (double bets, split hands) for authentic casino feel.
* Coins‚Äêbalance, bet entry, contextual status messages and result summary.

### Engineering Features
* **Clean separation** between `Blackjack.Core` (game logic) and `Blackjack.MAUI` (presentation layer).
* **Unit-ready** core ‚Äî no static state, deterministic deck class.
* **Attached layout helper** (`GridPosition`) gives CSS-grid-like coordinates inside an MAUI `AbsoluteLayout`.
* **AutoPlayHelper** demonstrates multithreaded orchestration, strategy decision tables and UI automation.
